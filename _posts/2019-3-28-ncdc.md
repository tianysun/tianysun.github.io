**International Latin Dance** is a part of my life. Fifteen years' training makes me more passionate, energetic, and persistent. I received the [Gold Medal Certificate](assets/img/gold.jpg) from China Ballroom Dance Federation and the [third place in the Fifth International Standard Dance Championship](assets/img/abdf2.jpg) from Asia Ballroom Dance Federation.

I was a dancing cordinator in the [International Latin Dance Club](https://tianyisun00234.github.io/teaching/) at UMN. In Spring 2019, we participated in two competitions one is the Dance fest, in donwtown Minneapolis, the other is National Collegiate DanceSport Championships, in Chicago.
