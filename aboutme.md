title: ABOUT ME

---
I am an incoming graduate student in the [Computational and Applied Mathematics](https://cam.uchicago.edu/) program in [Physical Sciences Division](https://physicalsciences.uchicago.edu/) at the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/).                  

I completed a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics (Computer Specialization) and a minor in Statistics at the [University of Minnesota Twin - Cities](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/). I was an undergraduate researcher advised by Prof. [Maria Gini](https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~gini/) and worked with Prof. [Karel Prikry](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karel_Prikry) on a [senior capstone project](seniorcapstoneproject.pdf) and Prof. [Gilad Lerman](http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~lerman/) on [MUDAC](http://www.mudac.org/mankato/). I was in Ecolab-UMN collaboration led by Jimmy Broomfield, where I am in Jimmy Broomfield's forecasting best team and Sarah Milstein's COVID-19 research group. Previously, I interned at CenterPoint Energy as a data analyst supervised by Tengran Liu.

My **research interests** lie in the general area of machine learning, particularly in unsupervised learning, Bayesian deep learning, and Meta-Learning, as well as their applications in sequential decision making and natural language understanding. I am also interested in applying AI techniques to address societal challenges, e.g., COVID-19 pandemic.
