title: ABOUT

---
I am a first year graduate student in [Computational and Applied Mathematics](https://cam.uchicago.edu/) in the [Physical Sciences Division](https://physicalsciences.uchicago.edu/) at the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/).                  

I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics *Computer Science Specialization* and minored in Statistics at the [University of Minnesota, Twin Cities](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/). I was an undergraduate researcher advised by Prof. [Maria Gini](https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~gini/) and worked with Prof. [Karel Prikry](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karel_Prikry) on a [senior capstone project](seniorcapstoneproject.pdf) and Prof. [Gilad Lerman](http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~lerman/) on [MUDAC2020](http://www.mudac.org/mankato/). I was in Ecolab-UMN collaboration led by Jimmy Broomfield, where I was in Jimmy Broomfield's forecasting best team and Sarah Milstein's clustering group. Previously, I interned at CenterPoint Energy as a data analyst supervised by Tengran Liu.

My research interests are Machine Learning Theory, Computational Geometry, Graph Representation Learning, Relational Learning, Optimization, Model Interpretation, Human Computer Interaction, Natural Language Understanding, Sequential Decision Making and applying AI techniques to address societal challenges.
