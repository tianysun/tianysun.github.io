I am a graduate student in [Committee on Computational and Applied Mathematics](https://cam.uchicago.edu/) in the [Physical Sciences Division](https://physicalsciences.uchicago.edu/) at [the University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/).                  

I received my Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics *Computer Specialization* at the [University of Minnesota, Twin Cities](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/). I was an undergraduate researcher advised by Prof. [Maria Gini](https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~gini/) and worked with Prof. [Karel Prikry](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karel_Prikry) on my [senior capstone project](/assets/img/seniorcapstoneproject.pdf) and Prof. [Gilad Lerman](http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~lerman/) on [MUDAC2020](http://www.mudac.org/mankato/). I was in Ecolab-UMN collaboration led by Dr. Jimmy Broomfield, where I was in Dr. Broomfield's forecasting best team and Dr. Sarah Milstein's clustering group. Previously, I interned at CenterPoint Energy as a data analyst supervised by Tengran Liu.

My research interests are Machine Learning Theory, Computational Geometry, Human-AI Interaction, and Natural Language Understanding as well as applying AI techniques to address societal challenges.
