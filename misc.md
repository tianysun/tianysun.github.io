I was so excited in the first several days at the University of Minnesota, I met lots of people and my second year's roomate at the U! I felt a sense of belongings!

I enjoyed the time while I was in International Latin Dance Club at UMN. Fifteen years' dance training makes me passionate, energetic, and persistent. Besides dancing, I like swimming, cycling, and working out too.
