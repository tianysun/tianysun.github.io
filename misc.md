I enjoyed the time while I was in International Latin Dance Club at UMN. Fifteen years' dance training makes me always persistent, energetic, and passionate.

In the second year of high school, I won the second place in 1km running race. I was excited and took a picture with my firends who won on others. Running makes me relax and recharge. I could be persistent and keep going while facing difficulties. I like swimming, biking, and working out as well.
