I enjoyed the time while I was in International Latin Dance Club at UMN. Fifteen years' dance training makes me always be persistent, energetic, and passionate.

In the second year of high school, I won the second place in 1km running race. I was excited and took a picture with my firends who won on others. Running makes me relax and recharge. I could be persistent while facing difficulties.
