I enjoyed the time while I was in International Latin Dance Club at UMN. Fifteen years' training makes me passionate, energetic, and persistent.

In the second year of high school, I won the second place in 1km running race. I was excited and took a picture with my firends who won on others. Running makes me relax and recharge. It makes me energetic and persistent to deal with the difficulties.
