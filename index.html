I am a graduate student in <a href="https://cam.uchicago.edu/">Committee on Computational and Applied Mathematics</a> 
in <a href="https://physicalsciences.uchicago.edu/">Physical Sciences Division</a>
at <a href="https://www.uchicago.edu/">The University of Chicago</a>.                  
<br>
I received my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics Computer Specialization 
at the <a href="https://twin-cities.umn.edu/">University of Minnesota</a>. 
I was an undergraduate researcher advised by Prof. <a href="https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~gini/">Maria Gini</a> and 
worked with Prof. <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karel_Prikry">Karel Prikry</a>
on my <a href=/assets/img/seniorcapstoneproject.pdf>senior capstone project</a> and 
Prof. <a href="http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~lerman/">Gilad Lerman</a> on <a href="http://www.mudac.org/mankato/">MUDAC2020</a>. 
I was in Ecolab-UMN collaboration led by Dr. Jimmy Broomfield, where 
I was in Dr. Broomfield's forecasting best team and Dr. Sarah Milstein's clustering group. 
Before that I interned a year at CenterPoint Energy as a data analyst.
<br>
My research interests are applied geometry, computational topology, machine learning, natural language processing 
and human-AI interaction as well as applying AI techniques to address societal challenges.
